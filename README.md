# TryHackMe Learning Notes

## About

Hi! I'm **Hareom**, a software developer transitioning into cybersecurity. This repository contains my learning notes and research from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) — a platform for learning cybersecurity through hands-on exercises.

## Purpose

As I progress through various TryHackMe rooms and learning paths, I'm documenting key concepts, techniques, and takeaways here. These notes serve as:

- **Personal reference** for future review and reinforcement
- **Knowledge base** for concepts I've learned and practiced
- **Public resource** that others can reference in their own learning journey

## How These Notes Are Created

I use **Claude Code** to help organize, structure, and format my notes based on what I learn from TryHackMe. The process is:

1. Complete TryHackMe rooms and exercises
2. Identify key concepts and techniques
3. Use Claude Code to help summarize and structure the information
4. Review and refine the notes based on my understanding

This approach helps me maintain consistent, well-organized documentation while reinforcing what I've learned.
